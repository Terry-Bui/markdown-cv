# My CV

This is my personalised curriculum vitae maintained in plain text and rendered to html and pdf using CSS.


### Building cv locally and output a PDF

The `make-pdf-local.sh` is provided and can be used to output the cv as a PDF. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) is needed. The script use pandoc and depends on LaTex packages so the required dependencies will need to be installed.
